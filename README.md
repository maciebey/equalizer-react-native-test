Quick test project to test viability of react-native version of my [equalizer project](https://github.com/maciebey/equalizer). Most likely pausing on this version, want to perfect web based version as easier to share and present

Uses Native Android Module for accessing Native Android Equalizer. Bulk source of code comes from [react-native-sound](https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound/), but all equalizer additions done by me. Relevant files:
- https://github.com/maciebey/equalizer-react-native-test/blob/main/android/app/src/main/java/com/rnmix/RNSoundModule.java
- https://github.com/maciebey/equalizer-react-native-test/blob/main/sound.js
